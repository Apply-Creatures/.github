## Usage 

To get started with Apply Creature, the hosted version of the component can be used. You can get started immediately after this URL resolves: [api.applycreatures.com](https://api.applycreatures.com). After the login page, you will be guided through creating your API key. The [website](https://applycreatures.com) provides an overview of the application, additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://docs.applycreatures.com).

## Development

Alternatively, instead of using the hosted version of the product, Apply Creatures may (partly) run locally for code generation purposes or contributions - if so, please refer to our [contributing](#contributing_anchor) section.

Running a Creature component
</summary> <br />

> **Note**
> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces, when navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+`-sign or the `Create codespace on master`-button.

Creatures are likely using needing nodejs, TypeScript. Some may require Docker.

**BEFORE** you run the following steps make sure:
1. You are using a supported node version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))
2. You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))
3. You have `docker` installed and running on your machine


1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/apply-creatures/someapplication.git && cd someapplication && npm install
```

2. Run the setup script, which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages, and setting up the workspace:
```shell
npm run setup:dev
```

3. Option 1: Running the required infrastructure - view infrastructure component logs


```shell
npm run docker:dev
```
3. Option 2: Running the required infrastructure - run the infrastructure components in background
```shell
npm run docker:dev -- -d
```

4. Apply database migrations
```shell
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

5. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under `serve:[application]` scripts of the package.json.

```shell
# running the server component
npm run serve:server

# running the client component
npm run serve:client

# running the data-service-generator component
npm run serve:dsg

# running the git-sync-manager component
npm run serve:git

# running the plugin-api component
npm run serve:plugins
```

> **Note**
> In order to run some creaturec client properly, both the client and server need to be started by the `npm run serve:[application]` command, as well as an additional component for development on a specific component.

The development environment should now be set up. Additional information on the different application components can be found under packages/`[application]`/README.md file. Happy hacking! üëæ
